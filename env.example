# Environment Variables for Baba Hebrew Translator
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# OpenAI API Key - Get yours from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# This is required for real translations to work
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Note: In Expo, environment variables prefixed with EXPO_PUBLIC_ 
# are available in the client-side code. For production apps,
# consider using a more secure backend service to handle API calls.

# Development Notes:
# - Without an API key, the app will use mock translations
# - Make sure to keep your actual .env file private (it's in .gitignore)
# - For production, consider using Expo's secure environment variables
